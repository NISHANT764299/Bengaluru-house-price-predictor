Bengaluru House Price Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices in Bengaluru based on various features such as location, size, number of bathrooms, and square footage. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this model helps users estimate house prices with high accuracy, providing valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

Features
Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to understand key trends and insights from the dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, remove outliers, and encode categorical features for effective model training.
Machine Learning Model: Train a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression) to predict house prices.
Web Interface: Build a user-friendly web application using Flask, HTML, and Bootstrap to allow users to input house details and get price predictions.
Tools and Technologies
